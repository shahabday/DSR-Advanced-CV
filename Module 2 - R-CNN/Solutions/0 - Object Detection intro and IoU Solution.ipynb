    "So far, we have built models that take images as an input and produce a single class or multiple classes present in the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine we have to build a self-driving car - the first thing to think about is the safety of passengers and the car's environment. We don't want to steer to the pedestrian accidentally. So we start by building a model for pedestrian detection, but we notice that our car stops once a pedestrian is detected in a frame! This behavior is logical since our classifier detects a human in the frame, but not it's a relative position to the car, and we do not estimate if the car can proceed with its driving. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach does not apply to our case; we need to change something! Enter Object detection - Using this task, we are not predicting if a pedestrian is in a frame, but its exact coordinates. Using this information, we can easily project it to our surroundings and decide that the pedestrian is standing on the red light, and we can proceed. \n",

    "\n",
    "Now, this is a simplified explanation, but the gist is there. The goal of object detection is to predict the exact location of an object in an image. To achieve this, we need to build a bit of different algorithms. Our predictions are coordinates of bounding boxes (it can be (X, Y) from the top left corner and height, width OR (X, Y) of center, and height and width). \n",
